            <div class="text"> A pilot crashes in the Sahara desert. While attempting to fix his plane a thousand miles from any habitation, he meets a strangely dressed little boy who seems to have come from nowhere and who demands that he draw a sheep. "When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey," so the pilot attempts to draw a sheep. Gradually the Little Prince reveals his story. He comes from a small asteroid, where he lived alone until a rose grew there. But the rose was demanding, and he was confused by his feelings about her. Eventually he decided to leave and journey to other planets in search of knowledge. After meeting many confusing adults, he eventually landed on Earth, where he befriended a snake and a fox. The fox helped him to understand the rose, and the snake offered to help him return to his planet - but at a price.
